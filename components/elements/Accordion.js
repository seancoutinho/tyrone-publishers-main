                            <p>To ensure the best quality print, please follow these guidelines when preparing your files:
                                File Format: Use high-resolution files in formats like PDF, TIFF, or EPS. JPEGs are acceptable but ensure they are high resolution (300 dpi).
                                Bleed and Margins: Include a 0.125-inch bleed around your design and ensure no important elements are within 0.25 inches of the edge.
                                Color Mode: Use CMYK color mode for accurate color representation in print. RGB is typically used for digital screens.</p>
